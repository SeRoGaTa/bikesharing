## Overview of Project

#### On this analysis you will find data and graphs about how is the behavior of a bike rental store in New York. The intention of this analysis is ment to show to a group of investors how this type of business could work in DesMoines Iowa, showing them how many rentals are different topics like:

- Age,

- Trip duration

#### With all these visual representations of data it's easier for the investors to analyze the data quik and take a correct desitions.

## Results

#### Analyzing these visuals it's easy to understand the data and get the results without mayor efforts and we can get insights of data like the following.

1. The males are the ones that rent more bike trips
2. Either 6 to 8 am and 4 to 6 pm are the most requested times for bike rides
3. Nearly all the bike trips less than 1 hour
4. People from all ages are willing to have a bike trip since there are not big disruptions in the quantity of rides by age

#### With this information, the investors could take some decitions but there might be also more questions, and that is ok, because with all the information gathered we could came up with an specific visualization of the data that could answer nearly any question.

## Summary
#### As I already mentioned on the results, the benefit of using this type of tool is the versatility you might have to present your data to different customers/users, since we could deliver almost anything with the graphs we have on Tableau with almost no effort at all. So, this give us a very quick response time to try to answer all our customer questions and/or inqueries.

Some of the good features of this tool are:

- The easy way to load data and view a sample of it.
- The easy way to create a calculated field that could help our story.
- The easy handling of the visualizations and also the automatic mode that helps you to choose the best visual to represent your data.
- The story mode that gives you the oportunity to create an easy way to tell your story to the users.
- And finally the dashboards, is an easy way to show multiple visuals in a sigle spot to help see more than one data at once.

#### With all this said, there are way to many oportunities to use this type of tool and represent data visually in order to make the decision making quicker and easier.
